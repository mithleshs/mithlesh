	 * maximum count. If maximum count doesn’t become more than n/2 then

	 * decrements the count, and if the count reaches 0 then changes the

	 * algorithm gives us a candidate element. In second phase we need to check
	 * if the candidate is really a majority element. Second phase is simple and
	 * can be easily done in O(n). We just need to check if count of the
	 * candidate element is greater than n/2.
